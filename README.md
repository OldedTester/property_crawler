This is a simple crawling program by python. Python is so powerful in programing for crawling data in internet.   Because our family wants to find/buy a house in ca, so I used this little program to get the property info instantly.
## Analyzing the web page
There are lots of ways and tools to analyze the web page. Here is my tools.
### chrome
Chrome is so powerful in developer mode. we can get   much information and help in chrome. By chrome I got the key url for my crawling realtor.ca.
### postman
Postman is another API tools I use to simulate the data. It is easy and convinent. By postman, I got the right datagram  format.
### pycharm
Pycharm is strongly recommended for python programming. It is powerful for debuging and tunning.

## Coding with python
After I got to know the format of realtor.ca, it take me about 2 days to finish the script. After I run and test it can work,I found there are so many warning in pycharm. So,it took me about 2 hours to adjust the coding style.
